## Vue Tutorial

Learn developing with Vue. This template should help get me started
developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

### 1. Getting Started

Hello, World!

### Declarative Rendering

Create a data property and use it as the text content for the `<h1>` in the 
template.

### Attribute Bindings

Add a dynamic class binding to the `<h1>`, using the titleClass data property 
as its value. If it's bound correctly, the text should turn red.

### 8.  Computed Property

Add the `filteredTodos` computed property and implement its computation 
logic! If implemented correctly, checking off a todo when hiding completed 
items should instantly hide it as well.
